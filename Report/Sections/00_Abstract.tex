Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) generally performs well in games where it is able to correctly simulate game states and adversarial behaviour. The goal of this paper is to explore whether MCTS is capable of performing well in partially observable games where there is no single best strategy for the adversary to use.

We compare four different versions of an MCTS controller for the game Robocode by matching them up against simple controllers included with the game. Our best controller performed quite poorly against the included controllers. Our results suggest that regular MCTS is unlikely to perform well in these kinds of environments, however a number of changes to the algorithm would likely result in a vast improvement of performance
