\section{Background}
\label{02}
Most games attempt to engage the player by presenting a number of challenges for the player to overcome. Sometimes these challenges consist of precision, timing, execution speed and reaction time, while in other cases the challenge consists of making a strategic choice. When making these strategic choices, a player must consider not only the present state of the game, but also the actions taken by the adversary (either another player, an artificial intelligence or the game itself). 



\subsection{Monte-Carlo Tree Search}
\label{02_MCTS}
% Discuss heuristic, general usefulness

\subsection{MCTS in Partially Observable Games}
% Mention other research, discuss potential problems with inaccurate evaluation of states



%Has this been done before? 
%How? 
%If not, what’s the closest related research? (Both using similar approaches and other algorithms.) 
%What’s novel with your research?
