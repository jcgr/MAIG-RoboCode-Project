\subsection{Monte-Carlo implementation}
\label{04_MCTS}

Our implementation of the MCTS algorithm differs from the original MCTS algorithms in a couple of ways. One is one we read about in relation to using MCTS for Pac-Man\cite{pepels2012enhancements}, the other is specific to Robocode and how our simulation works.

\subsubsection{Child selection}

When a node selects which child it should explore, normal MCTS chooses based on the UCT\cite{kocsis2006bandit} value of the children. It can happen, however, that a child ends up in a loss on the first exploration how the simulation plays out, even though most ways through that child are good. This leaves that child with a low UCT value, and it is thus not explored again for a long time. In order to prevent this from happening, we only use UCT for exploration once all children have been visited more than 3 times.

\subsubsection{Max search depth}

Due to the nature of Robocode, we are unable to simulate our opponents properly. This means that our simulations become more inaccurate the further down the tree we go. We chose to incorporate a maximum search depth to prevent simulations that were too inaccurate from disturbing the tree too much. We chose a maximum search depth of 25, as it lets us reach a simulation that is relevant, without risking that the simulation is almost the opposite of what is actually happening.
