How does your algorithm work? Describe in as much detail as you can fit into the report. 
%Differences between standard MCTS and ours (see pacman paper?)
%Monte-Carlo Tree Search parameters (both static and variable)
%Gamestate representation
%Gamestate simulation (incl. assumptions about current gamestate and actions taken by enemy robot)
%Branching factor + interval for considered moves
%Scoring System (both score modifiers and evaluation function)

Also, how did you interface it to the game?
% Part of the game, simple programming task
